\chapter{Abstract}

The essence of the game "Who Am I" lies in the challenge of correctly guessing the identity each player represents. This thesis delves into determining the number of questions necessary to pinpoint the person being portrayed. Such an inquiry serves as an ideal candidate for employing reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, given their iterative and experimental nature. It is expected that the outcomes achieved through RL will parallel those of a stochastic solution, as RL essentially simulates stochastic calculations. However, given the relatively straightforward nature of this task, utilizing RL may seem excessive. Therefore, this thesis embarks on a comprehensive comparison between stochastic and RL methodologies, aiming to discern the most suitable approach for this specific use case.
