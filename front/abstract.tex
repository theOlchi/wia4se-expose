\chapter{Abstract}

The game "Who Am I" is all about guessing which person a player is representing. Thus, it is a perfect example for the usage of reinforcement learning, due to its trial and error approach. The outcome should be equivalent to that of a stochastic solution because the "RL-Approach" can be seen as a simulation of stochastic calculation. Since using RL for this relatively simple question may be considered overkill, this thesis serves as an overall comparison between stochastic and RL solutions, exploring when it makes sense to use each. Furthermore, this thesis clarifies the number of questions required to identify the represented person.
